Giulio's LLM-based Research Assistant Chatbot.

This repository hosts the code I wrote to implement a personal research assistant for interacting with academic papers in a Q&A format. The envisioned use case involves maintaining a folder full of research papers in PDF format and querying the chatbot about their contents.
The chatbot should leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as well as possibly other chain of thought techniques to fetch the relevant passages from the dataset and reason on them to provide insightful answers.
I also plan to integrate a version of this system on my personal website to facilitate discussions about my research work with users.
